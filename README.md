# Progresso em PLN em portugues

Essa colecao de links sao para ajudar na minha pesquisa pessoal de PLN em portugues.

1. Pra comecar a palestra que eu fiz na Microsoft Research em 2010 sobre PLN em portugues, propondo o uso de LFG/XLE para o portugues.
O objetivo (alcancado) foi o de conseguir uma licenca XLE pra FGV e depois uma para Leonel Alencar(Ceara).
Os slides antigos estao em https://www.slideshare.net/valeria.depaiva/portuguese-nlp-for-fgv e depois em
https://www.slideshare.net/valeria.depaiva/pargram2011 (project update).

2. Then a project with Alexandre Rademaker and Gerard de Melo which produced OpenWordNet-PT http://www.openwordnet-pt.org.

This was picked up by Francis Bond to be the Portuguese wordnet in the Open Multilingual Wordnet 
(http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/omw/) and this help us a lot. 
Google Translate (https://translate.google.com/intl/en/about/license/) and Babelnet decided to use our  data too.

We've written comparisons to other Portuguese wordnets with the authors of other wordnets.
so I feel good about our resource being the best opensource one, given our constraints and theirs.
But this does not mean the resource is good, yet. As I keep repeating 

"Linguistic resources are very easy to start working on, very hard to improve and extremely difficult to maintain."

or something like this, as I've heard somewhere, perhaps in the meetings of the ACQUILEX project many moons ago.
