# Progresso em PLN em portugues

This collection of links is to help me in my research on 'NLP in Portuguese'.

1. To begin with the talk I gave at Microsoft Research (PARGRAM meeting) in 2010 suggesting the use of LFG/XLE for Portuguese.
The goal (reached) was to get a  XLE license for  FGV and, after a while, one for  Leonel Alencar (Univ. Ceara).

the old slides:

2. Then the OpenWordNet-PT project with Alexandre Rademaker and Gerard de Melo

the user interface is in http://www.openwordnet-pt.org.

the code in https://github.com/own-pt/

Our wordnet was picked up by Francis Bond to be the Portuguese wordnet in the Open Multilingual Wordnet 
(http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/omw/) and this helped us a lot. 

Google Translate (https://translate.google.com/intl/en/about/license/) and Babelnet decided to use our  data too.

We've written comparisons to other Portuguese wordnets with the authors of other wordnets.
so I feel good about our resource being the best opensource one for Portuguese, given our constraints and theirs.
But this does not mean the resource is good, yet. As I keep repeating 

"Linguistic resources are very easy to start working on, very hard to improve and extremely difficult to maintain."

or something like this, as I've heard somewhere, perhaps in the meetings of the ACQUILEX project many moons ago.

Anyways in the blog post https://logic-forall.blogspot.com/2018/12/who-uses-openwordnet-pt.html I discuss some of the work arising from OWN-PT.

3. Work on Universal Dependencies (https://universaldependencies.org/) for Portuguese

Together with Claudia Freitas, Livy Real, Alexandre Rademaker, Fabricio Chalub and Edward Bick (https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Portuguese-Bosque/tree/master)

(I don't know why my name is not there anymore!) But personally I am working now on the PUD-PT, as it's more manageable.

4. Nominals in Portuguese (joint work with Livy Real and Alexandre Rademaker) Some old slides that have not been presented in 2014,

5. Inference in Portuguese
