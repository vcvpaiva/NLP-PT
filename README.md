# Progresso em PLN em portugues

This collection of links is to help me in my research on 'NLP in Portuguese'.

1. To begin with the talk I gave at Microsoft Research (PARGRAM meeting) in 2010 suggesting the use of LFG/XLE for Portuguese.
The goal (reached) was to get a  XLE license for  FGV and, after a while, one for  Leonel Alencar (Univ. Ceara).

https://www.slideshare.net/valeria.depaiva/pargram2011 (project update)

2. Then the OpenWordNet-PT project with Alexandre Rademaker and Gerard de Melo, to begin with

the user interface is in http://www.openwordnet-pt.org.

the code in https://github.com/own-pt/

Our wordnet was picked up by Francis Bond to be the Portuguese wordnet in the Open Multilingual Wordnet 
(http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/omw/) and this helped us a lot. 

Google Translate (https://translate.google.com/intl/en/about/license/) and Babelnet decided to use our  data too.

3. Work on NOMLEX-BR with Livy Real, papers https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W14-0152.pdf, http://gerard.demelo.org/papers/nomlex-pt-extending.pdf
repo https://github.com/own-pt/nomlex-pt, slides: https://www.slideshare.net/valeria.depaiva/nomlex-gwa

I want to go back to this, as it relates to even older work with Olya Gurevich, Dick Crouch and Tracy King.

4. We've written comparisons to other Portuguese wordnets with the authors of other wordnets.
so I feel good about our resource being the best opensource one for Portuguese, given our constraints and theirs.
But this does not mean the resource is good, yet. As I keep repeating 

"Linguistic resources are very easy to start working on, very hard to improve and extremely difficult to maintain."

or something like this, as I've heard somewhere, perhaps in the meetings of the ACQUILEX project many moons ago.

Anyways in the blog post https://logic-forall.blogspot.com/2018/12/who-uses-openwordnet-pt.html I discuss some of the work arising from OWN-PT.

5. Work on Universal Dependencies (https://universaldependencies.org/) for Portuguese

Together with Claudia Freitas, Livy Real, Alexandre Rademaker, Fabricio Chalub and Edward Bick (https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Portuguese-Bosque/tree/master)

(I don't know why my name is not there anymore, this seems wrong to me!) 

But personally I am working now on the PUD-PT, as it's more manageable and it's parallel with English.

6. Inference in Portuguese 

Together with Livy Real, Milos Stanojevic and plenty of good guys from USP we produced SICK-BR, a translation (humanly verified) of the corpus SICK for NL inference.

The paper is in http://vcvpaiva.github.io/includes/pubs/2018-propor.pdf
